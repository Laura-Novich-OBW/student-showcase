# General Putnam Motel Diner API Documentation for the Burger Meal

## Introduction
The General Putnam Motel Diner API allows patrons of the diner to order their meals in a touchless manner via an app. For the purposes of the required POC, this API documentation is limited to ordering the Burger Meal at lunch time as a take-out order. In the future, the final product will include a full menu for different meal times.  

### A Basic Workflow for Placing an Order on the App  
(For the purposes of this POC, the workflow is limited to only selecting take-out for the Table ID, lunch for the mealType, and a Burger Meal for the MealCat.)

## Overview
The API is used to interface between the app and the server in the diner kitchen. Two main functions are presented:  
* **THE POST CALL:**
  * The app sends a command to the server: An order is submitted.
  * The server sends a response to the app acknowledging receipt of the request: The order is accepted and is printed in the kitchen for the meal to be prepared.  
* **THE GET CALL:**
  * The app requests information from the server: The bill is requested.
  * The server sends a response to the app: A bill is generated and a printout is given to the patron.
