# Welcome to the Our Best Words GitHub Repository!
My name is Laura Novich and I teach Advanced Technical Communication at Our Best Words.
This repository was created to showcase our student's work with GitHub.

* Each assignment is explained in the [student-assignments](student-assignments/readme.md) directory.
* Each student's work is in the [student-work](student-work/readme.md) directory.

Feel free to browse and look at their work! Even better, contact me at lauran@ourbestwords.com for student information or information about the courses available at [Our Best Words](https://ourbestwords.com/).

Featured Projects include:

* [A Tech Comm Glossary of Terminology](https://laura-novich-obw.github.io/glossary/)
* [Technical Communication Resource List](https://laura-novich-obw.github.io/TC-Resource-List/)
* Final project documenting an API &mdash; located in each student's folder
