## Experience summary
I have been in technical communications for more than 30 years with more than 22 years with **IBM UK Ltd** as a technical sales specialist, latterly in the area of Data and AI. This role primarily comprises presenting IBMâ€™s products to technical and business audiences across potential customers as well as prospective business partners, in both oral and written forms. I was responsible for producing content for:
* Tailored customer presentations
* Pre-tender Preliminary Questionnaires (PPQs)
* Formal responses to Invitations to Tender (ITTs)
* Requests for Proposal (RFPs).

I have experience with various document editing and composition tools including 
* _Adobe FrameMaker_
  * FrameMaker was the tool I used when co-authoring an IBM Redbook (see below).
* _RoboHelp_
* _Madcap Flare_ 

While living in Israel earlier in my career, I worked for **Fibronics** in Haifa and then **Telrad** in Lod, as a technical writer before starting my own technical writing company, ___The Last Word___. I also was the publishing consultant for a start-up daily newspaper, ___The Nation___, where I used _Ventura Publisher_ from page prep to press for each daily run as well as a weekend magazine. 

I am a published author having co-authored the official IBM Redbook on IBM's unstructured text classification module during a six-week residency at IBM's Jerusalem development laboratories. [IBMâ€™s Classification Module](https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg247707.pdf)

I left IBM at the end of June 2023 and am currently living in Bet Shemesh. I am looking for a position as a technical writer commensurate with my considerable skills and experience in the hi-tech sector.

My mother-tongue is English and my conversational Ivrit is fluent.
