## General Putnam Motel Diner - Orders  

# Introduction

The General Putnam Motel Diner API allows you to order for meals through their app.  
There are two main parts to this:  
* **GET** request - This is a call sent when the client asks for the bill. The GET request includes the Table number and order number.   
Takeout orders are table 99.  Documented in [Get.md](https://github.com/RinaSol/student-showcase/blob/API_Project/GET.md)   
* **POST** request - This command is to process the requested order and is sent to the kitchen.  
  On receiving an OK, the order is printed in the kitchen so that the cook can begin cooking. Documented in [POST.md](https://github.com/RinaSol/student-showcase/blob/API_Project/POST.md)
